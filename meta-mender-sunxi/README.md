- [OrangPi Zero](https://hub.mender.io/t/orangepi-zero/142/3)
- [OrangPi Pc Plus](https://hub.mender.io/t/orangepi-pc-plus/73/2)

Visit the individual board links above for more information on status of the
integration and more detailed instructions on how to build and use images
together with Mender for the mentioned boards.

*NOTE*! Even though the integration has only been tested on OrangePi PC Plus
all the SUNXI boards share the same U-boot configuration
(where the integration work is) which means that it probably works on other
boards as well without any additional work.
